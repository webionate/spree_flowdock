SpreeFlowdock
=============

This extensions adds a - at this point limited - Flowdock integration to Spree Commerce.

So far you can receive an order confirmation within the team inbox of a defined flow.

The message will inform you about a completed order directly after the customer finishes the frontend checkout process. Moreover the message will contain the order number, the order total and a link to the order within the admin interface.

Installation
------------

Add spree_flowdock for Spree Commerce 3.0.0 to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_flowdock', git: 'https://github.com/webionate/spree_flowdock.git', branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Configuration
-------------

  * Go to Spree's admin interface and select the configuration tab from main nav.
  * Select Flowdock from the right hand second level menu.
  * Enter the API token of the flow you would like to push messages to.

You can find your Flowdock API tokens here: https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
